      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>
        We are a mountaineering and hiking club based in Glasgow and founded in 2022. We were created to focus on the 20s and 30s age groups within and around the city, but are open to all. Our aim is to create a group of friendly, kind and like-minded people who like to get out and have challenging days in the mountains, safely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our main activities are harder hill and mountain hiking, winter walking, as well as some scrambling and easy climbing. We also enjoy other outdoor activities in Scotland such as skiing and trail running.
      </p>
      <p>
        We try to run official club day trips around every other weekend, and have weekend trips away to further afield locations. We also have an active social side in the city, with pub trips and indoor climbing/bouldering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the winter season, we do require some experience of winter walking in order to join on our walks - and some of this training can be organized as a group through the club.
